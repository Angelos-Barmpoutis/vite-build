# Vite Build

Vite Build is a starter project for building modern web applications with Vite, a fast build tool that significantly speeds up the development workflow. This project is a template for developing applications that use modern web technologies such as ECMAScript Modules, SASS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Vite Build project, first clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Angelos-Barmpoutis/vite-build.git
```

Then, navigate into the project directory and install the dependencies:

```sh
cd vite-build
npm install
```

### Dependencies

This project depends on several packages:

- `vite`: The build tool used for this project.
- `page-init`: A Node.js command-line utility used to generate boilerplate files.
- `webpify`: Converts images to WebP format.
- `postcss`: A CSS post-processor used to transform CSS files.
- `autoprefixer`: A PostCSS plugin used to automatically add vendor prefixes to CSS rules.
- `sass`: A CSS preprocessor used to write CSS with nested rules and variables.

### Scripts

This project provides several scripts that can be used to build and run the application:

- `dev`: Starts a development server with hot-reloading.
- `build`: Builds the application for production.
- `serve`: Serves the production build locally.
- `init`: Initializes a new Vite Build project in the current directory.

To run one of these scripts, use the `npm run` command followed by the script name. For example:

```sh
npm run dev
```
